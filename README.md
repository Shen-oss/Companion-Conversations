# Companion Conversations: Integrating GPT Model Text and Voice Simulation with Practical Applications in Virtual Characters

In this project, we introduced a character from a game, Paimon, along with its personality traits. Through our character setup, our project goes beyond a typical GPT chatbot. We have also endowed it with visual and auditory features, making the interaction with it more engaging and lively.
